                            </div>

                            <h4>General</h4>
    <p>
      This is our cookies policy (“Cookies Policy”). References to “we”, “us”, “our” or “Kreek Send” means Kreek Send Inc. and its subsidiaries, including Kreek Send Europe Limited and Kreek Send Ghana  Ltd.
    </p>
   
    <p>
      We and our third-party service providers use cookies and other tracking mechanisms (including tracking technologies designed for mobile applications) to track information about your use of our website (“Website”) and our services available through this Website, our mobile website, or our mobile application (“Services”). We may combine this information with other personal information we collect from you (and our third-party service providers may do so on our behalf). The information set out in this Cookies Policy is provided in addition to our Privacy Policy and should be read alongside it, as well as our Terms and Conditions, as applicable.
    </p>

    <h4>What is a cookie?</h4>
    <p>
      Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your web browser for record-keeping purposes. Some cookies allow us to make it easier for you to navigate our Website and Services, while others are used to enable a faster log-in process or to allow us to track your activities at our Website and Services.
    </p>

    <h4>Types of cookies we use</h4>
    <p>
      We use both first and third-party cookies. Whether a cookie is ‘first’ or ‘third’ party refers to the domain placing the cookie. First party cookies are those set by a website that is being visited by the user at the time, in this case cookies placed by us and our Websites. A third-party cookie is set by another entity or domain than the website being visited.
    </p>

    <p>
        There are five types of cookies:
    </p>

    <div>
        <ul class="main">
            <li>
              <b>Strictly Necassary Cookie.</b> 
              These cookies are necessary for the Website to function and cannot be switched off in our systems. 
              They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services,
               such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in or filling in forms. You can set your browser to block or 
               alert you about these cookies, but some parts of the Website will not then work. These cookies do not store 
               personally identifiable information. 
              They include, for example, cookies that enable users to log into secure areas of our Website.
            </li>
            <li><b>Statistics Cookies.</b> Statistics Cookies collect information anonymously. This information helps us to understand how our visitors use our Website.</li>
            <li><b>Performance Cookies.</b> 
              These types of cookies allow us to recognize, count the number of visitors and traffic sources so we can 
              measure and improve the performance of our site. They help us to know which pages are the most and least 
              popular and see how visitors move around our Website when they are using it. This assists us to improve the way
               in which our Website works, for example, by ensuring that you can find what you are looking for easily. 
               All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. If you do not allow these 
              cookies we will not know when you have visited our site and will not be able to monitor its performance.
            </li>

            <li><b>Functional Cookies.</b> 
              These cookies are used to recognize you when you return to our Website. They enable the Website to provide
               enhanced functionality, personalization of content, recognition of users, and also remember your user 
               preferences (for example, your choice of language or region). They may be set by us or by third party
                providers whose services we have added to our pages. 
              If you do not allow these cookies, then some or all of these services may not function properly.
            </li>

            <li><b>Marketing Cookies.</b> These cookies record your visit to our Website, the individual pages visited, 
              and the links followed. If the cookie is set by a third party (for example, an advertising network) which also 
              monitors 
              traffic on other websites, this type of cookie may also be used to track your movements across different websites and to create profiles of your general online behaviour. Information collected by tracking cookies is commonly used to target online advertising. 
              Marketing cookies comprise of Social Media cookies and Targeting cookies:
                <div class="main-inner mt-3">
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Social Media cookies are set by a range of social media services that we have added to our Website to enable you to share our content with your friends and networks. 
                      They are capable of tracking your browser across other sites and building up a profile of your interests. 
                      This may impact the content and messages you see on other websites you visit. If you do not allow these cookies you may not be able to use or see these sharing tools.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      Targeting cookies may be set through our Website by our advertising partners.
                       They may be used by those companies to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant adverts on 
                       other sites. They do not store directly personal information but are based on uniquely identifying your browser 
                       and internet device. If you do not allow these cookies, you will experience less targeted advertising. We use both first and third-party cookies.
                        Whether a cookie is ‘first’ or ‘third’ party refers to the domain placing the cookie. First party cookies are those set by a website that is being visited by the user at the time, in this case cookies placed by us and our Websites. A third-party cookie is set by another entity or domain than the website being visited. 
                      There are four types of cookies:
                      <h5 class="font-weight-bold mt-3">OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES</h5>
                        <b>Local Storage Objects.</b> 
                        We may use Flash Local Storage Objects (“Flash LSOs”) to store your Website preferences and to personalize your visit. 
                        Flash LSOs are different from browser cookies because of the amount and type of data stored. Typically, 
                        you cannot control, delete, or disable the acceptance of Flash LSOs through your web browser. For more information on Flash LSOs, or to learn how to manage your settings for Flash LSOs, go to the Adobe Flash Player Help Page, choose “Global Storage Settings Panel” and follow the instructions. 
                        To see the Flash LSOs currently on your computer, choose “Website Storage Settings Panel” and follow the instructions to review and, if you choose, to delete any specific Flash LSO.
                        <br/><br/>
                        <b>HTML5 Storage.</b> We may also store your user information and Website preferences locally within your web browser via HTML5.
                        <br/><br/>
                        <b>Clear Gifs, Pixel Tags and Other Technologies.</b>  Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer’s hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages. We may use clear GIFs (a.k.a. web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our Website or Services to, among other things, track the activities of website visitors, help us manage content, and compile statistics about the Website and Services usage. We and our third-party service providers also use clear GIFs in HTML emails to our customers, to help us track email response rates, identify when our emails are viewed, 
                        and track whether our emails are forwarded.
                      </li>
                  </ul>
                </div>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4>CHANGING OR DISABLING YOUR COOKIE SETTINGS</h4>
          <p>
            Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer you can edit your browser options to block them in the future. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Visitors to our Website who disable their web browsers’ ability to accept cookies will be able to browse the Website; h
            most site features will not function if you disable cookies and you will not be able to login to use our Services.
          </p>

          <p>
            You can also withdraw consent to the placement of cookies at any time by accessing the Privacy Preference Centre on our Website under “Cookies Settings” which can be found on our Website footer. You can reject all cookies except strictly necessary cookies. However, please note that in order to delete all cookies across all your devices you will need to separately adjust your cookie settings for each device.
            For further general information on cookies and more detailed advice on how to disable and enable them please go to http://www.allaboutcookies.org.
          </p>

          <h4>DO NOT TRACK</h4>
          <p>
            Currently, our systems do not honor browser “do-not-track” requests. You may, however, disable certain tracking as discussed above (e.g., by disabling Cookies); you also may opt-out of Third Party Analytics or targeted advertising by following the instructions in the Third Party Ad Networks section below.
          </p>

          <h4>THIRD PARTY ANALYTICS</h4>
          <p>
            We use automated devices and applications, such as Google Analytics to evaluate use of our Website and the Services. You can opt-out of Google Analytics by using the Cookies Settings which can be found on our Website footer or under https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/. Please note that if you use a new or different computer, install a new browser or clear your cookies,
             you will need to re-opt-out through the link above.
          </p>

          <p>
            We use these tools to help us improve our Services, performance and user experiences. These entities may use cookies and other tracking technologies to perform their services. These third parties may collect your device ID, IP address, 
            or other information about your use of the Services as part of the analytics they provide to us.
          </p>
          
          <h4>THIRD-PARTY AD NETWORKS</h4>
          <p>
            We use third parties, such as network advertisers and other marketing agents, to display advertisements on our Website, to assist us in displaying advertisements on third party websites, and to evaluate the success of our advertising campaigns. Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits to our Website and unrelated third-party websites. This enables us and these third parties to target advertisements by displaying ads for products and services in which you might be interested. Third-party ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you. These third-party cookies and other technologies are governed by each third party’s specific privacy policy, not this one. We may provide these third-party advertisers with information about your use of our Website and our Services, as well as aggregate or non-personally 
            identifiable information about visitors to our Website and users of our Services.
          </p>

          <p>
            You may opt-out of many third-party ad networks, including those operated by members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) and the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”). For more information regarding this practice by NAI members and DAA members, and your choices regarding having this information used by these companies, including how to opt-out of third-party ad networks operated by NAI and DAA members, please visit their respective websites: www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp (NAI) and www.aboutads.info/choices (DAA).
          </p>

          <p>
            Opting out of one or more NAI member or DAA member networks (many of which will be the same) only means that 
            those members no longer will deliver targeted content or ads to you. It does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content or ads on our Website or other websites. You may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that you are viewing. Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different computer or mobile device or change web browsers, your NAI or DAA opt-out may no longer be effective.
             Additional information is available on NAI’s and DAA’s websites accessible by the above links.
